## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a data acquisition system for research in space seismology. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use Github, how to code ÂµC arm cortex M, how to design PCB... 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on challenges related to drones or robotics or embedded systems...
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with Furuta pendulum implementation...
